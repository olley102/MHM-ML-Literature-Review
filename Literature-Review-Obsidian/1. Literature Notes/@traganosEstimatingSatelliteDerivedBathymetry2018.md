> Bathymetry mapping forms the basis of understanding physical, economic, and ecological processes in the vastly biodiverse coastal fringes of our planet which are subjected to constant anthropogenic pressure. Here, we pair recent advances in cloud computing using the geospatial platform of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) with optical remote sensing technology using the open Sentinel-2 archive, obtaining low-cost in situ collected data to develop an empirical preprocessing workflow for estimating satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB). The workflow implements widely used and well-established algorithms, including cloud, atmospheric, and sun glint corrections, image composition and radiometric normalisation to address intra- and inter-image interferences before training, and validation of four SDB algorithms in three sites of the Aegean Sea in the Eastern Mediterranean. Best accuracy values for training and validation were R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 1.39 m, and R2 = 0.9, RMSE = 1.67 m, respectively. The increased accuracy highlights the importance of the radiometric normalisation given spatially independent calibration and validation datasets. Spatial error maps reveal over-prediction over low-reflectance and very shallow seabeds, and under-prediction over high-reflectance (<6 m) and optically deep bottoms (>17 m). We provide access to the developed code, allowing users to map bathymetry by customising the time range based on the field data acquisition dates and the optical conditions of their study area.
