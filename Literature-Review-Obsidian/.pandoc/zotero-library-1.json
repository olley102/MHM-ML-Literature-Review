[{"id":"barnettGlobalEnvironmentalChange2020","abstract":"Though rarely described as such, vulnerability to climate change is fundamentally a matter of political economy. This progress report provides a reading of contemporary research on vulnerability to climate change through a political economic lens. It interprets the research as explaining the interplay between ideas about vulnerability, the institutions that create vulnerability, and those actors with interests in vulnerability. It highlights research that critiques the idea of vulnerability, and that demonstrates the agency of those at risk as they navigate the intersecting, multi-scalar and teleconnected institutions that shape their choices in adapting to climate change. The report also highlights research that is tracking the way powerful institutions and interests that create vulnerability are themselves adapting by appropriating the cause of the vulnerable, depoliticising the causes of vulnerability, and promoting innovations in finance and markets as solutions. In these ways, political and economic institutions are sustaining themselves and capitalising on the opportunities presented by climate change at the expense of those most at risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Barnett","given":"Jon"}],"citation-key":"barnettGlobalEnvironmentalChange2020","container-title":"Progress in Human Geography","DOI":"10.1177/0309132519898254","ISSN":"0309-1325","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1172-1184","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Global environmental change II: Political economies of vulnerability to climate change","title-short":"Global environmental change II","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132519898254","volume":"44"},{"id":"blytheBlueJusticeReview2023","abstract":"Abstract \n            The term “blue justice” was coined in 2018 during the 3rd World Small-Scale Fisheries Congress. Since then, academic engagement with the concept has grown rapidly. This article reviews 5 years of blue justice scholarship and synthesizes some of the key perspectives, developments, and gaps. We then connect this literature to wider relevant debates by reviewing two key areas of research – first on blue injustices and second on grassroots resistance to these injustices. Much of the early scholarship on blue justice focused on injustices experienced by small-scale fishers in the context of the blue economy. In contrast, more recent writing and the empirical cases reviewed here suggest that intersecting forms of oppression render certain coastal individuals and groups vulnerable to blue injustices. These developments signal an expansion of the blue justice literature to a broader set of affected groups and underlying causes of injustice. Our review also suggests that while grassroots resistance efforts led by coastal communities have successfully stopped unfair exposure to environmental harms, preserved their livelihoods and ways of life, defended their culture and customary rights, renegotiated power distributions, and proposed alternative futures, these efforts have been underemphasized in the blue justice scholarship, and from marine and coastal literature more broadly. We conclude with some suggestions for understanding and supporting blue justice now and into the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Blythe","given":"Jessica L."},{"family":"Gill","given":"David A."},{"family":"Claudet","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Nathan J."},{"family":"Gurney","given":"Georgina G."},{"family":"Baggio","given":"Jacopo A."},{"family":"Ban","given":"Natalie C."},{"family":"Bernard","given":"Miranda L."},{"family":"Brun","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Darling","given":"Emily S."},{"family":"Di Franco","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Epstein","given":"Graham"},{"family":"Franks","given":"Phil"},{"family":"Horan","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Jupiter","given":"Stacy D."},{"family":"Lau","given":"Jacqueline"},{"family":"Lazzari","given":"Natali"},{"family":"Mahajan","given":"Shauna L."},{"family":"Mangubhai","given":"Sangeeta"},{"family":"Naggea","given":"Josheena"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Rachel A."},{"family":"Zafra-Calvo","given":"Noelia"}],"citation-key":"blytheBlueJusticeReview2023","container-title":"Cambridge Prisms: Coastal Futures","container-title-short":"Camb. prisms Coast. futures","DOI":"10.1017/cft.2023.4","ISSN":"2754-7205","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"e15","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Blue justice: A review of emerging scholarship and resistance movements","title-short":"Blue justice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S2754720523000045/type/journal_article","volume":"1"},{"id":"cinnerBuildingAdaptiveCapacity2018","abstract":"To minimize the impacts of climate change on human wellbeing, governments, development agencies, and civil society organizations have made substantial investments in improving people’s capacity to adapt to change.

It highlights how some interventions inadvertently reinforce, redistribute or create new sources of vulnerability. Four mechanisms drive these maladaptive outcomes: (i) shallow understanding of the vulnerability context; (ii) inequitable stakeholder participation in both design and implementation; (iii) a retrofitting of adaptation into existing development agendas; and (iv) a lack of critical engagement with how ‘adaptation success’ is defined. Emerging literature shows potential avenues for overcoming the current failure of adaptation interventions to reduce vulnerability: first, shifting the terms of engagement between adaptation practitioners and the local populations participating in adaptation interventions; and second, expanding the understanding of ‘local’ vulnerability to encompass global contexts and drivers of vulnerability. An important lesson from past adaptation interventions is that within current adaptation cum development paradigms, inequitable terms of engagement with ‘vulnerable’ populations are reproduced and the multi-scalar processes driving vulnerability remain largely ignored. In particular, instead of designing projects to change the practices of marginalised populations, learning processes within organisations and with marginalised populations must be placed at the centre of adaptation objectives. We pose the question of whether scholarship and practice need to take a post-adaptation turn akin to post-development, by seeking a pluralism of ideas about adaptation while critically interrogating how these ideas form part of the politics of adaptation and potentially the processes (re)producing vulnerability. We caution that unless the politics of framing and of scale are explicitly tackled, transformational interventions risk having even more adverse effects on marginalised populations than current adaptation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Eriksen","given":"Siri"},{"family":"Schipper","given":"E.

Pre-existing social injustices increase the sensitivity of affected individuals to change and limit their capacity to adapt or benefit from the interacting impacts of triple exposure. We argue that external implementors cannot effectively and equitably achieve climate, economic, and conservation goals without prioritizing social justice and building general resilience. We therefore recommend that implementors: (1) address root causes of vulnerability, namely pre-existing social injustices; (2) use participatory systems approaches to improve understanding of local contexts and potential consequences of proposed initiatives; and (3) leverage inclusive partnerships to facilitate collaborative design and implementation. These strategies—applied together and adapted to local contexts—can support well-being, justice, and resilience within coastal communities experiencing rapid change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Gill","given":"David A."},{"family":"Blythe","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Louisa"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Katrina"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Rachel A."},{"family":"Baggio","given":"Jacopo A."},{"family":"Baker","given":"Dana"},{"family":"Ban","given":"Natalie C."},{"family":"Brun","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Claudet","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Darling","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Di Franco","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Epstein","given":"Graham"},{"literal":"Estradivari"},{"family":"Gray","given":"Noella J."},{"family":"Gurney","given":"Georgina G."},{"family":"Horan","given":"Rebecca P."},{"family":"Jupiter","given":"Stacy D."},{"family":"Lau","given":"Jacqueline D."},{"family":"Lazzari","given":"Natali"},{"family":"Lestari","given":"Peni"},{"family":"Mahajan","given":"Shauna L."},{"family":"Mangubhai","given":"Sangeeta"},{"family":"Naggea","given":"Josheena"},{"family":"Selig","given":"Elizabeth R."},{"family":"Whitney","given":"Charlotte K."},{"family":"Zafra-Calvo","given":"Noelia"},{"family":"Muthiga","given":"Nyawira A."}],"citation-key":"gillTripleExposureReducing2023","container-title":"One Earth","container-title-short":"One Earth","DOI":"10.1016/j.oneear.2023.01.010","ISSN":"2590-3322","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,17]]},"page":"118-130","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Triple exposure: Reducing negative impacts of climate change, blue growth, and conservation on coastal communities","title-short":"Triple exposure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332223000386","volume":"6"},{"id":"jacquetMultilateralAgreementOffers2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Jacquet","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Carmine","given":"Gabrielle"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"jacquetMultilateralAgreementOffers2023","container-title":"Science Advances","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.adj1435","issue":"25","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,21]]},"page":"eadj1435","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","source":"science.org (Atypon)","title":"UN multilateral agreement offers an opportunity to protect high seas biodiversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj1435","volume":"9"},{"id":"pautassoTenSimpleRules2013","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Pautasso","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"pautassoTenSimpleRules2013","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003149","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7,18]]},"language":"en","page":"e1003149","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Ten Simple Rules for Writing a Literature Review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003149","volume":"9"},{"id":"ResearchStrategyOceanbased2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,8]]},"citation-key":"ResearchStrategyOceanbased2022","DOI":"10.17226/26278","event-place":"Washington, D.C.","ISBN":"978-0-309-08761-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,25]]},"publisher":"National Academies Press","publisher-place":"Washington, D.C.","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Research Strategy for Ocean-based Carbon Dioxide Removal and Sequestration","type":"book","URL":"https://www.nap.edu/catalog/26278"},{"id":"seddonUnderstandingValueLimits2020","abstract":"There is growing awareness that ‘nature-based solutions' (NbS) can help to protect us from climate change impacts while slowing further warming, supporting biodiversity and securing ecosystem services. However, the potential of NbS to provide the intended benefits has not been rigorously assessed. There are concerns over their reliability and cost-effectiveness compared to engineered alternatives, and their resilience to climate change. Trade-offs can arise if climate mitigation policy encourages NbS with low biodiversity value, such as afforestation with non-native monocultures. This can result in maladaptation, especially in a rapidly changing world where biodiversity-based resilience and multi-functional landscapes are key. Here, we highlight the rise of NbS in climate policy—focusing on their potential for climate change adaptation as well as mitigation—and discuss barriers to their evidence-based implementation. We outline the major financial and governance challenges to implementing NbS at scale, highlighting avenues for further research. As climate policy turns increasingly towards greenhouse gas removal approaches such as afforestation, we stress the urgent need for natural and social scientists to engage with policy makers.

Others are progressing, helped by sea warming, such as Cymodocea nodosa and the non-native Halophila stipulacea. The decline of one seagrass can favor another seagrass. All in all, the decline of seagrasses could be less extensive and less general than claimed by some authors. Natural recolonization (cuttings and seedlings) has been more rapid and more widespread than was thought in the 20th century; however, it is sometimes insufficient, which justifies transplanting operations. Many techniques have been proposed to restore Mediterranean seagrass meadows. However, setting aside the short-term failure or half-success of experimental operations, long-term monitoring has usually been lacking, suggesting that possible failures were considered not worthy of a scientific paper. Many transplanting operations (e.g., P. oceanica) have been carried out at sites where the species had never previously been present. Replacing the natural ecosystem (e.g., sandy bottoms, sublittoral reefs) with P. oceanica is obviously inappropriate in most cases.

New Zealand's Te Urewera Act. Sierra Club v Disney. These legal phrases hardly sound like the makings of a revolution, but beyond the headlines portending environmental catastrophes, a movement of immense import has been building--in courtrooms, legislatures, and communities across the globe. Cultures and laws are transforming to provide a powerful new approach to protecting the planet and the species with whom we share it. Lawyers from California to New York are fighting to gain legal rights for chimpanzees and killer whales, and lawmakers are ending the era of keeping these intelligent animals in captivity. In Hawaii and India, judges have recognized that endangered species--from birds to lions--have the legal right to exist. Around the world, more and more laws are being passed recognizing that ecosystems--rivers, forests, mountains, and more--have legally enforceable rights. And if nature has rights, then humans have responsibilities. In The Rights of Nature, noted environmental lawyer David Boyd tells this remarkable story, which is, at its heart, one of humans as a species finally growing up.

In most cases, ancient data are available in the form of maps whose reliability must be estimated before comparison. In the study area (near Marseilles, France), a series of maps of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica beds spanning more than one century (dating from 1883, 1897, 1958, 1975, 1979, 1991 and 2000, respectively) are available. In addition, a new map was established, using aerial photography (shallow areas), side scan sonar (deeper areas) and data validation by ground truth. In order to help assess the value of the ancient maps, a Reliability Index (RI) is proposed. The RI, rated from 0 to 50, weighs three parameters: (i) the initial scale of the map (source map) and the working scale (target map); (ii) the method of data acquisition (e.g. dredges, grabs, aerial photography, side scan sonar, scuba diving); and (iii) the method of data georeferencing. Dramatic differences in the distribution of seagrass beds are apparent between the eight maps. In view of the biological features of P. oceanica (e.g. slow rate of change of the meadow limits under natural conditions and the persistence of rhizomes after its death), it is possible that some of these differences may not reflect change over time but may be due to errors in the ancient maps. In contrast, other differences are plausible and validated by field data, e.g. the regression of the lower limit of the meadow. It was thus possible to compare the calculated RI for each map and the plausibility of observed differences as a basis for calibrating the RI.","container-title":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecss.2003.09.007","ISSN":"0272-7714","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","page":"353-362","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A one-century suite of seagrass bed maps: can we trust ancient maps?","title-short":"A one-century suite of seagrass bed maps","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771403003019","volume":"59","author":[{"family":"Leriche","given":"Agathe"},{"family":"Boudouresque","given":"Charles-François"},{"family":"Bernard","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Bonhomme","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Denis","given":"Jacques"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,29]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",2,1]]},"citation-key":"lericheOnecenturySuiteSeagrass2004","library":"My Library","citekey":"lericheOnecenturySuiteSeagrass2004"},{"id":"astruchMappingStateConservation2012","type":"document","abstract":"Not available","source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"Mapping and state of conservation of benthic marine habitats and assemblages of Port-Cros national Park (Provence, France, northwestern Mediterranean Sea).

The mapped area covers more than 310 000 ha, almost all infralittoral and circalittoral, with a survey up to 150 m deep around the coast of Cap Corse. While within the infralittoral zone, Posidonia oceanica meadows are predominant, with a surface area of about 53 735 ha, in the circalittoral zone, soft bottoms (eg coastal detritic bottoms) are largely dominant, with the rhodolith association particularly well represented (26 493 ha). The coralligenous biocenosis (2 111 ha) covers relatively small areas but includes unique formations at Mediterranean scale: the coralligenous atolls. The reliability scale proposed to assess the accuracy of these maps shows satisfactory results (62% on average), with a higher value for the infralittoral zone (74%). The results confirm that Corsica's coastline is characterized by a significant expansion of the Blue Carbon ecosystems, and in particular the Posidonia oceanica meadows, which regularly reach more than 35 m depth and cover 61% of the of the seabed between 0 and -40m, and free-living coralline algae (8% of the known surfaces in the western Mediterranean basin).

The results show that none of the seagrass restoration programs developed in Europe by the participants during the last 10 years was successful. Furthermore, an informal review of data published in seagrass restoration success, showed that the results reported were biased because they were mostly based on a very short monitoring period (i.e. <1 year). Numerous decision trees, guidelines, and restoration models have been developed to aid seagrass restoration management, but the results of this workshop point toward a new paradigm in seagrass restoration were efforts should shift to give priority to natural restoration potential, with an emphasis on the fact that restoration should never be considered the first alternative when planning for the mitigation of coastal development projects or to justify mitigation as a compensation measure for economic activities.","container-title":"Restoration Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1526-100X.2012.00878.x","ISSN":"1526-100X","issue":"4","language":"en","license":"© 2012 Society for Ecological Restoration International","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2012.00878.x","page":"427-430","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Changing Paradigms in Seagrass Restoration","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2012.00878.x","volume":"20","author":[{"family":"Cunha","given":"Alexandra H."},{"family":"Marbá","given":"Núria N."},{"family":"Katwijk","given":"Marieke M.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Pickerell","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Henriques","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Bernard","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"M.

However, such maps are difficult to generate due to the broad geographic range of coral reefs, the complexities of relating satellite imagery to geomorphic or ecological realities, and other challenges. However, reef extent maps are one of the most commonly used and most valuable data products from the perspective of reef scientists and managers. Here, we used convolutional neural networks to generate a globally consistent coral reef probability map—a probabilistic estimate of the geospatial extent of reef ecosystems—to facilitate scientific, conservation, and management efforts. We combined a global mosaic of high spatial resolution Planet Dove satellite imagery with regional Millennium Coral Reef Mapping Project reef extents to build training, validation, and application datasets. These datasets trained our reef extent prediction model, a neural network with a dense-unet architecture followed by a random forest classifier, which was used to produce a global coral reef probability map. Based on this probability map, we generated a global coral reef extent map from a 60% threshold of reef probability (reef: probability ≥ 60%, non-reef: probability < 60%). Our findings provide a proof-of-concept method for global reef extent estimates using a consistent and readily updateable methodology that leverages modern deep learning approaches to support downstream users.

Although these methods have become quite popular in recent years, they are not new. The use of AI methods began in the 1950s and environmental scientists were adopting them by the 1980s. Although an “AI winter” temporarily slowed the growth, a more recent resurgence has brought it back with gusto. This paper tells the story of the evolution of AI in the field through the lens of the AMS Committee on Artificial Intelligence Applications to Environmental Science. The environmental sciences possess a host of problems amenable to advancement by intelligent techniques. We review a few of the early applications along with the ML methods of the time and how their progression has impacted these sciences. While AI methods have changed from expert systems in the 1980s to neural networks and other data-driven methods, and more recently deep learning, the environmental problems tackled have remained similar. We discuss the types of applications that have shown some of the biggest advances due to AI usage and how they have evolved over the past decades, including topics in weather forecasting, probabilistic prediction, climate estimation, optimization problems, image processing, and improving forecasting models. We finish with a look at where AI as employed in environmental science appears to be headed and some thoughts on how it might be best blended with physical/dynamical modeling approaches to further advance our science.","container-title":"Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society","DOI":"10.1175/BAMS-D-20-0234.1","ISSN":"0003-0007, 1520-0477","issue":"5","page":"E1351-E1370","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The History and Practice of AI in the Environmental Sciences","URL":"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/103/5/BAMS-D-20-0234.1.xml","volume":"103","author":[{"family":"Haupt","given":"Sue Ellen"},{"family":"Gagne","given":"David John"},{"family":"Hsieh","given":"William W."},{"family":"Krasnopolsky","given":"Vladimir"},{"family":"McGovern","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Marzban","given":"Caren"},{"family":"Moninger","given":"William"},{"family":"Lakshmanan","given":"Valliappa"},{"family":"Tissot","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Williams","given":"John K."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,22]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5]]},"citation-key":"hauptHistoryPracticeAI2022","library":"My Library","citekey":"hauptHistoryPracticeAI2022"},{"id":"achantaSLICSuperpixelsCompared2012","type":"article-journal","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","DOI":"10.1109/TPAMI.2012.120","ISSN":"0162-8828, 2160-9292","issue":"11","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Trans.

For example, the well-known hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) color space, which separates hue from saturation and intensity and is similar to the color perception of humans, can aid many computer vision applications. For high-dimensional images, such as multispectral or hyperspectral images, transformation images to a color space that can separate hue from saturation and intensity would be useful; however, the related works are limited. Some methods could interpret a set of high-dimensional images to hue, saturation, and intensity, but these methods need to reduce the dimension of original images to three images and then map them to the trichromatic color space of RGB. Generally, dimension reduction could cause loss or distortion of original data, and, therefore, the transformed color spaces could not be suitable for material classification in critical conditions. This paper describes a method that can transform high-dimensional images to a color space called hyper-hue-saturation-intensity (HHSI), which is analogous to HSI in high dimensions. The transformation does not need dimension reduction, and, therefore, it can preserve the original information. Experimental results indicate that the hyper-hue is independent of saturation and intensity and it is more suitable for material classification of proximal or remote sensing images captured in a natural environment where illumination usually cannot be controlled.","container-title":"JOSA A","DOI":"10.1364/JOSAA.34.000523","ISSN":"1520-8532","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"J.

However, it has been reported that seagrass area is decreasing at a rapid rate in many parts of the world, mostly due to anthropogenic activities including global change (pollution and climate change). The aim of this review article is to highlight the range of current tools for studying seagrasses as well as identify the benefits and limitations of a range of remote sensing and traditional methodologies. This paper provides a discussion of the ecological importance of seagrass meadows, and recent trends and developments in seagrass research methods are discussed including the use of satellite images and aerial photographs for seagrass monitoring and various image processing steps that are frequently utilised for seagrass mapping. The extensive use of various optical, Radar and LiDAR data for seagrass research in recent years has also been described in detail. The review concludes that the recent explosion of new methods and tools available from a wide range of platforms combined with the recent recognition of the importance of seagrasses provides the research community with an excellent opportunity to undertake a range of timely research. This research should include mapping the extent and distribution of seagrasses, identifying the drivers of change and factors that confer resilience, as well as quantification of the ecosystem services provided. Whilst remotely sensed data provides an important new tool it should be used in conjunction with traditional methods for validation and with a knowledge of the limitations of results and careful interpretation.","container-title":"Ecological Indicators","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106560","ISSN":"1470-160X","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Indicators","page":"106560","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Opportunities for seagrass research derived from remote sensing: A review of current methods","title-short":"Opportunities for seagrass research derived from remote sensing","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X20304970","volume":"117","author":[{"family":"Veettil","given":"Bijeesh Kozhikkodan"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Raymond D."},{"family":"Lima","given":"Mariana Do Amaral Camara"},{"family":"Stankovic","given":"Milica"},{"family":"Hoai","given":"Pham Ngoc"},{"family":"Quang","given":"Ngo Xuan"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,3]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,1]]},"citation-key":"veettilOpportunitiesSeagrassResearch2020","library":"My Library","citekey":"veettilOpportunitiesSeagrassResearch2020"},{"id":"lyonsUnderstandingTemporalSpatial2013","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The spatial and temporal dynamics of seagrasses have been well studied at the leaf to patch scales, however, the link to large spatial extent landscape and population dynamics is still unresolved in seagrass ecology. Traditional remote sensing approaches have lacked the temporal resolution and consistency to appropriately address this issue. This study uses two high temporal resolution time-series of thematic seagrass cover maps to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of seagrass at both an inter- and intra-annual time scales, one of the first globally to do so at this scale. Previous work by the authors developed an object-based approach to map seagrass cover level distribution from a long term archive of Landsat TM and ETM+ images on the Eastern Banks (≈200 km2), Moreton Bay, Australia. In this work a range of trend and time-series analysis methods are demonstrated for a time-series of 23 annual maps from 1988 to 2010 and a time-series of 16 monthly maps during 2008–2010. Significant new insight was presented regarding the inter- and intra-annual dynamics of seagrass persistence over time, seagrass cover level variability, seagrass cover level trajectory, and change in area of seagrass and cover levels over time. Overall we found that there was no significant decline in total seagrass area on the Eastern Banks, but there was a significant decline in seagrass cover level condition. A case study of two smaller communities within the Eastern Banks that experienced a decline in both overall seagrass area and condition are examined in detail, highlighting possible differences in environmental and process drivers. We demonstrate how trend and time-series analysis enabled seagrass distribution to be appropriately assessed in context of its spatial and temporal history and provides the ability to not only quantify change, but also describe the type of change. We also demonstrate the potential use of time-series analysis products to investigate seagrass growth and decline as well as the processes that drive it. This study demonstrates clear benefits over traditional seagrass mapping and monitoring approaches, and provides a proof of concept for the use of trend and time-series analysis of remotely sensed seagrass products to benefit current endeavours in seagrass ecology.","container-title":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecss.2013.01.015","ISSN":"0272-7714","journalAbbreviation":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","page":"42-53","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Towards understanding temporal and spatial dynamics of seagrass landscapes using time-series remote sensing","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771413000644","volume":"120","author":[{"family":"Lyons","given":"Mitchell B."},{"family":"Roelfsema","given":"Chris M."},{"family":"Phinn","given":"Stuart R."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,3]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,20]]},"citation-key":"lyonsUnderstandingTemporalSpatial2013","library":"My Library","citekey":"lyonsUnderstandingTemporalSpatial2013"},{"id":"salcedo-sanzMachineLearningInformation2020","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper reviews the most important information fusion data-driven algorithms based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques for problems in Earth observation.

This paper presents the first review of AI-based methodologies and data fusion strategies used for environmental monitoring, to the best of the authors’ knowledge. The first part of the article discusses the main challenges of geographical image analysis. Thereafter, a well-designed taxonomy is introduced to overview the existing frameworks, which have been focused on: (i) detecting different environmental impacts, e.g. land cover land use (LULC) change, gully erosion susceptibility (GES), waterlogging susceptibility (WLS), and land salinity and infertility (LSI); (ii) analyzing AI models deployed for extracting the pertinent features from RS images in addition to data fusion techniques used for combining images and/or features from heterogeneous sources; (iii) describing existing publicly-shared and open-access datasets; (iv) highlighting most frequent evaluation metrics; and (v) describing the most significant applications of ML and data fusion for RS image analysis. This is followed by an overview of existing works and discussions highlighting some of the challenges, limitations and shortcomings. To provide the reader with insight into real-world applications, two case studies illustrate the use of AI for classifying LULC changes and monitoring the environmental impacts due to dams’ construction, where classification accuracies of 98.57% and 97.05% have been reached, respectively.

Despite operational challenges, this approach is considered key to optimising conservation outcomes whilst making efficient use of limited resources. Drawing on lessons learnt from the UK's MPA Programme we discuss the practical issues which arise from: i) effective selection of conservation features identified as surrogates for biodiversity, ii) adequacy of feature representation across the MPA network and iii) implementation of quantifiable conservation objectives and ability to monitor progress in relation to them [4,5]. There is recognition that high-level feature surrogates adopted for MPA designation may not adequately represent the full range of biodiversity present across UK marine habitats, and several of these features are indiscernible using acoustic mapping techniques. This results in our inability to accurately map their distribution and extent. Additionally, monitoring progress in relation to conservation targets is hampered by a lack of reliable indicators to assess change in their ecological status. Recommendations for the optimisation of MPA designation and monitoring using a systematic, evidence based approach are provided. These include: 1) flexibility in feature classifications to allow additional features to be designated as required, 2) communication of limitations in the evidence base to enable informed use in adaptive management decisions, 3) use of innovative technologies to more accurately map habitat features and 4) development of wider UK and regional sea scale monitoring programmes which align with an ecosystem based approach to the ongoing assessment of marine biodiversity.","container-title":"Marine Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103717","ISSN":"0308-597X","journalAbbreviation":"Marine Policy","page":"103717","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Challenges of habitat mapping to inform marine protected area (MPA) designation and monitoring: An operational perspective","title-short":"Challenges of habitat mapping to inform marine protected area (MPA) designation and monitoring","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X19301022","volume":"111","author":[{"family":"Ware","given":"Suzanne"},{"family":"Downie","given":"Anna-Leena"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,7]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,1]]},"citation-key":"wareChallengesHabitatMapping2020","library":"My Library","citekey":"wareChallengesHabitatMapping2020"},{"id":"benzakenGoodGovernanceSustainable2022","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The blue economy has emerged as an influential global concept. It is commonly understood to relate to the development of the ocean in a manner which also addresses concerns about ocean health in the face of increasing demands on ocean resources, marine pollution, and climate change. Whilst the blue economy holds potential to act as an integrating policy framework for the sustainable development of the ocean, to date, there are limited examples of implementation in practice to test the usefulness of the concept. Based on a typology of ‘good governance’ adapted from existing global typologies, we investigated the role of blue economy governance in enabling integration. We used a mixed methods approach to explore the experience of Seychelles, a blue economy early adopter, combining policy and institutional analysis, semi structured interviews with key government and partners and in country fieldwork. Our analysis shows that from its inception, Seychelles’ vision of blue economy was for a transformative model of development based on the protection and sustainable use of ocean resources for the benefits of Seychellois, consistent with the SDGs. Thanks to early political leadership and international engagement, the adoption of the blue economy concept was successful in raising awareness of the ocean health and its connection to people and the economy, and in establishing the basis of a national blue economy “architecture’ which helped secure innovative finance for implementation. Transitioning to implementation, several governance challenges emerged. These included maintaining high-level political momentum, stakeholder engagement and institutional coordination and capacity. Whilst some governance barriers to effective integration may be unique to Seychelles, some are common to SIDS, and others are found in a range of governance settings. Seychelles international visibility has brought high expectations, not always commensurate with local aspirations, capabilities, and jurisdictional responsibilities. Bridging the gap between global expectations and local realities will require support for locally driven institutional reforms which take account of issues of scale, culture, and capacity.","container-title":"Frontiers in Political Science","DOI":"10.3389/fpos.2022.1040318","ISSN":"2673-3145","journalAbbreviation":"Front.

Loss of seagrass habitat because of anthropogenic disturbances and evidence of their limited resilience have provided the impetus for investigating and monitoring habitat restoration through transplantation programmes. Although Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry is becoming a more and more relevant technique for mapping underwater environments, no standardised methods currently exist to provide 3-dimensional high spatial resolution and accuracy cartographic products for monitoring seagrass transplantation areas. By synthesizing various remote sensing applications, we provide an underwater SfM-based protocol for monitoring large seagrass restoration areas. The data obtained from consumer-grade red-green-blue (RGB) imagery allowed the fine characterization of the seabed by using 3D dense point clouds and raster layers, including orthophoto mosaics and Digital Surface Models (DSM). The integration of high spatial resolution underwater imagery with object-based image classification (OBIA) technique provided a new tool to count transplanted Posidonia oceanica fragments and estimate the bottom coverage expressed as a percentage of seabed covered by such fragments. Finally, the resulting digital maps were integrated into Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to run topographic change detection analysis and evaluate the mean height of transplanted fragments and detect fine-scale changes in seabed vector ruggedness measure (VRM). Our study provides a guide for creating large-scale, replicable and ready-to-use products for a broad range of applications aimed at standardizing monitoring protocols in future seagrass restoration actions.","container-title":"Journal of Environmental Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.114262","ISSN":"0301-4797","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Environmental Management","page":"114262","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Seagrass restoration monitoring and shallow-water benthic habitat mapping through a photogrammetry-based protocol","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479721023240","volume":"304","author":[{"family":"Ventura","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"Mancini","given":"Gianluca"},{"family":"Casoli","given":"Edoardo"},{"family":"Pace","given":"Daniela Silvia"},{"family":"Lasinio","given":"Giovanna Jona"},{"family":"Belluscio","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Ardizzone","given":"Giandomenico"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,15]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,15]]},"citation-key":"venturaSeagrassRestorationMonitoring2022","library":"My Library","citekey":"venturaSeagrassRestorationMonitoring2022"},{"id":"coganRoleMarineHabitat2009","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Cogan, C.

The role of marine habitat mapping in ecosystem-based management. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 2033–2042.Ecosystem-based management (EBM) and the related concept of large marine ecosystems (LMEs) are sometimes criticized as being too broad for many management and research applications. At the same time, there is a great need to develop more effectively some substantive scientific methods to empower EBM. Marine habitat mapping (MHM) is an example of an applied set of field methods that support EBM directly and contribute essential elements for conducting integrated ecosystem assessments. This manuscript places MHM practices in context with biodiversity models and EBM. We build the case for MHM being incorporated as an explicit and early process following initial goal-setting within larger EBM programmes. Advances in MHM and EBM are dependent on evolving technological and modelling capabilities, conservation targets, and policy priorities within a spatial planning framework. In both cases, the evolving and adaptive nature of these sciences requires explicit spatial parameters, clear objectives, combinations of social and scientific considerations, and multiple parameters to assess overlapping viewpoints and ecosystem functions. To examine the commonalities between MHM and EBM, we also address issues of implicit and explicit linkages between classification, mapping, and elements of biodiversity with management goals. Policy objectives such as sustainability, ecosystem health, or the design of marine protected areas are also placed in the combined MHM–EBM context.","container-title":"ICES Journal of Marine Science","DOI":"10.1093/icesjms/fsp214","ISSN":"1054-3139","issue":"9","journalAbbreviation":"ICES Journal of Marine Science","page":"2033-2042","source":"Silverchair","title":"The role of marine habitat mapping in ecosystem-based management","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsp214","volume":"66","author":[{"family":"Cogan","given":"Christopher B."},{"family":"Todd","given":"Brian J."},{"family":"Lawton","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Noji","given":"Thomas T."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,22]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",10,1]]},"citation-key":"coganRoleMarineHabitat2009","library":"My Library","citekey":"coganRoleMarineHabitat2009"},{"id":"mckenzieGlobalDistributionSeagrass2020","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Seagrass meadows globally are under pressure with worldwide loss and degradation, but there is a growing recognition of the global importance of seagrass ecosystem services, particularly as a major carbon sink and as fisheries habitat.

Accordingly, the main objective of this study is the generation of benthic maps using high spatial resolution multispectral images from the WorldView-2/3 satellites. In this context, one of the main challenges consists of eliminating the disturbances caused in the signal by the atmosphere, the sea surface, and the water column. Regarding the water column correction, there is controversy about its effectiveness to improve the results achieved. To assess the impact of the water column correction in seagrass mapping, two coastal areas with different characteristics have been selected. Specifically, an analysis has been carried out consisting of the assessment of the Lyzenga and Sagawa water column correction models to identify the algorithm that provides the best mapping precision and, additionally, to seek if this pre-processing stage is helpful when classifying the seabed. The classification models selected for the study were: Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Subspace KNN (S-KNN). Machine learning techniques have proven to achieve better results and, in particular, SVM and KNN models provide the best overall accuracy. The results after benthic mapping have demonstrated, that image classification without water column corrections provides better accuracy (95.36% and 99.20%) than using Lyzenga (73.49% and 97.80%) or Sagawa (82.04% and 99.10%), for Case 2 and 1 waters, respectively.","container-title":"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","DOI":"10.1016/j.jag.2022.102990","ISSN":"1569-8432","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","page":"102990","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Seagrass mapping using high resolution multispectral satellite imagery: A comparison of water column correction models","title-short":"Seagrass mapping using high resolution multispectral satellite imagery","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569843222001819","volume":"113","author":[{"family":"Mederos-Barrera","given":"A."},{"family":"Marcello","given":"J."},{"family":"Eugenio","given":"F."},{"family":"Hernández","given":"E."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,23]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,1]]},"citation-key":"mederos-barreraSeagrassMappingUsing2022","library":"My Library","citekey":"mederos-barreraSeagrassMappingUsing2022"},{"id":"hossainApplicationRemoteSensing2015","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This review evaluates various methods employed to produce seagrass habitat maps using optical and acoustic remote-sensing (RS) techniques coupled with in situ sampling to highlight recent advances and to define areas where potential future research should be focused in the application of RS technologies.

A necessary first step is to quantify spatial patterns of marine assemblages in order to understand the ecosystem's structure, function, and services. However, the large spatial scale, high economic value, and density of human activities in nearshore habitats often makes quantifying this component of marine ecosystems especially daunting. To address this challenge, we developed an assessment method that employs abiotic proxies to rapidly characterize marine assemblages in nearshore benthic environments with relatively high resolution. We evaluated this assessment method along 300 km of the State of Maine's coastal shelf (<100 m depth), a zone where high densities of buoyed lobster traps typically preclude extensive surveys by towed sampling gear (i.e., otter trawls). During the summer months of 2010–2013, we implemented a stratified-random survey using a small remotely operated vehicle that allowed us to work around lobster buoys and to quantify all benthic megafauna to species. Stratifying by substrate, depth, and coastal water masses, we found that abiotic variables explained a significant portion of variance (37–59%) in benthic species composition, diversity, biomass, and economic value. Generally, the density, diversity, and biomass of assemblages significantly increased with the substrate complexity (i.e., from sand-mud to ledge). The diversity, biomass, and economic value of assemblages also decreased significantly with increasing depth. Last, demersal fish densities, sessile invertebrate densities, species diversity, and assemblage biomass increased from east to west, while the abundance of mobile invertebrates and economic value decreased, corresponding mainly to the contrasting water mass characteristics of the Maine Coastal Current system (i.e., summertime current direction, speed, and temperature). Integrating modeled predictions with existing GIS layers for abiotic conditions allowed us to scale up important assemblage attributes to define key foundational ecological principles of MSP and to find priority regions where some bottom-disturbing activities would have minimal impact to benthic assemblages. We conclude that abiotic proxies can be strong forcing functions for the assembly of marine communities and therefore useful tools for spatial extrapolations of marine assemblages in congested (heavily used) nearshore habitats.","container-title":"Ecological Applications","DOI":"10.1002/eap.1469","ISSN":"1939-5582","issue":"2","language":"en","license":"© 2016 by the Ecological Society of America","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eap.1469","page":"603-618","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Abiotic proxies for predictive mapping of nearshore benthic assemblages: implications for marine spatial planning","title-short":"Abiotic proxies for predictive mapping of nearshore benthic assemblages","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.1469","volume":"27","author":[{"family":"McHenry","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Steneck","given":"Robert S."},{"family":"Brady","given":"Damian C."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,4]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"citation-key":"mchenryAbioticProxiesPredictive2017","library":"My Library","citekey":"mchenryAbioticProxiesPredictive2017"},{"id":"dumbauldPredictedChangesSeagrass2022","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Estuaries and Coasts","DOI":"10.1007/s12237-022-01060-2","ISSN":"1559-2723, 1559-2731","issue":"7","journalAbbreviation":"Estuaries and Coasts","language":"en","page":"1823-1841","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Predicted Changes in Seagrass Cover and Distribution in the Face of Sea Level Rise: Implications for Bivalve Aquaculture in a US West Coast Estuary","title-short":"Predicted Changes in Seagrass Cover and Distribution in the Face of Sea Level Rise","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12237-022-01060-2","volume":"45","author":[{"family":"Dumbauld","given":"Brett R."},{"family":"Graham","given":"Erin R."},{"family":"McCoy","given":"Lee M."},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Nathaniel S."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,5]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11]]},"citation-key":"dumbauldPredictedChangesSeagrass2022","library":"My Library","citekey":"dumbauldPredictedChangesSeagrass2022"},{"id":"haComparativeAssessmentEnsembleBased2020","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Seagrass has been acknowledged as a productive blue carbon ecosystem that is in significant decline across much of the world.

Using a group of validation metrics including F1, precision, recall, accuracy, and the McNemar test, our results indicated that machine learning techniques outperformed the MLC with RoF as the best performer (F1 scores ranging from 0.75–0.91 for sparse and dense seagrass meadows, respectively).

Monitoring estuary productivity at large scales can inform ecosystem scale responses to environmental stressors (climate change, pollution and habitat degradation). Here we use a case study to show how Sentinel-2 data can be used to estimate estuary-wide emerged and submerged gross primary productivity (GPP) on intertidal flats by coupling a new machine learning model to map seagrass and unvegetated habitats with literature-derived photosynthesis-irradiance (P – I) relationships. The model consisted of (1) supervised classification with random forest to delineate seagrass and unvegetated areas and (2) artificial neural network (ANN) regression to predict % seagrass coverage. Our seagrass delineation by supervised classification had an overall accuracy of 0.96, while the ANN regression on seagrass coverage provided high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.71 and RMSE = 0.11). The estimated GPP showed seagrass contributed slightly more to intertidal benthic productivity than MPB in the case-study estuary over the 3-year study period. This model can be used to predict the response of seagrass and MPB GPP to sea level rise, which shows that the future state may be very sensitive to increased turbidity. For example, by the year 2100, the model shows a sharp decline in productivity with sea level rise, assuming current turbidity trends, (loss of up to 52–53 % for seagrass and 23–45 % for MPB, a function of whether shoreward migration of seagrass is incorporated). However, GPP under conditions of unchanging turbidity (and no seagrass migration), exhibits minimal negative impact of sea level rise (loss of 3 % for seagrass and increase of 29 % for MPB). Therefore, controlling water turbidity might be an efficient solution to maintaining the current GPP as sea level rises.","container-title":"Science of The Total Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167389","ISSN":"0048-9697","journalAbbreviation":"Science of The Total Environment","page":"167389","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Scaling up benthic primary productivity estimates in a large intertidal estuary using remote sensing","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723060163","volume":"906","author":[{"family":"Shao","given":"Zhanchao"},{"family":"Bryan","given":"Karin R."},{"family":"Lehmann","given":"Moritz K."},{"family":"Flowers","given":"Georgina J.

Human impacts to coastal seascapes are pervasive, necessitating management and restoration actions that are assessed against quantitative targets. Relationships between metrics of habitat condition and animal assemblages can be used to identify where management interventions should aim to maximise outcomes for key functions and services. In this study, we surveyed fish assemblages (using underwater videography) and habitat condition (focusing on the size, composition and complexity of habitats) of five estuarine ecosystems (mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, saltmarsh, log snags and rocky outcrops) across 13 estuaries over two years (for n = 981 sites) in southeast Queensland, Australia. We used generalised additive models to quantify relationships and identify thresholds between metrics indexing habitat condition and key metrics of fish assemblages (species richness and abundance), and used these models to calculate optimal habitat condition values that maximise habitat value for fish and fisheries. We also identified indicator fish species whose abundance correlated with these optimal values. Metrics of habitat condition that index food availability for fish (such as algae and oyster cover) or broader habitat complexity (such as seagrass height or mangrove canopy cover) were consistently important for fish biodiversity and abundance. Relationships were readily translated into optimal values for key metrics of habitat condition for four of the five ecosystems surveyed. We propose that incorporating optimal values of habitat condition into management would maximise the abundance of key indicator fish species, including several which are important fisheries targets. The findings of this study will help managers to identify the optimal condition requirements of coastal ecosystems, thereby maximising the effectiveness and efficiency of often sparse management resources.","container-title":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecss.2023.108250","ISSN":"0272-7714","journalAbbreviation":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","page":"108250","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Identifying optimal values of coastal habitat condition for management and restoration","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771423000409","volume":"282","author":[{"family":"Perry","given":"Hannah J."},{"family":"Goodridge Gaines","given":"Lucy A."},{"family":"Borland","given":"Hayden P."},{"family":"Henderson","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Olds","given":"Andrew D."},{"family":"Mosman","given":"Jesse D."},{"family":"Gilby","given":"Ben L."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,5]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,5]]},"citation-key":"perryIdentifyingOptimalValues2023","library":"My Library","citekey":"perryIdentifyingOptimalValues2023"},{"id":"goodwinCoherentSpaceTime2023","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Seagrass meadows are a highly productive and economically important shallow coastal habitat. Their sensitivity to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, combined with their importance for local biodiversity, carbon stocks, and sediment dynamics, motivate a frequent monitoring of their distribution. However, generating time series of seagrass cover from field observations is costly, and mapping methods based on remote sensing require restrictive conditions on seabed visibility, limiting the frequency of observations. In this contribution, we examine the effect of accounting for environmental factors, such as the bathymetry and median grain size (D50) of the substrate as well as the coordinates of known seagrass patches, on the performance of a random forest (RF) classifier used to determine seagrass cover. Using 148 Landsat images of the Venice Lagoon (Italy) between 1999 and 2020, we trained an RF classifier with only spectral features from Landsat images and seagrass surveys from 2002 and 2017. Then, by adding the features above and applying a time-based correction to predictions, we created multiple RF models with different feature combinations. We tested the quality of the resulting seagrass cover predictions from each model against field surveys, showing that bathymetry, D50, and coordinates of known patches exert an influence that is dependent on the training Landsat image and seagrass survey chosen. In models trained on a survey from 2017, where using only spectral features causes predictions to overestimate seagrass surface area, no significant change in model performance was observed. Conversely, in models trained on a survey from 2002, the addition of the out-of-image features and particularly coordinates of known vegetated patches greatly improves the predictive capacity of the model, while still allowing the detection of seagrass beds absent in the reference field survey. Applying a time-based correction eliminates small temporal variations in predictions, improving predictions that performed well before correction. We conclude that accounting for the coordinates of known seagrass patches, together with applying a time-based correction, has the most potential to produce reliable frequent predictions of seagrass cover. While this case study alone is insufficient to explain how geographic location information influences the classification process, we suggest that it is linked to the inherent spatial auto-correlation of seagrass meadow distribution. In the interest of improving remote-sensing classification and particularly to develop our capacity to map vegetation across time, we identify this phenomenon as warranting further research.","container-title":"Biogeosciences","DOI":"10.5194/bg-20-4551-2023","ISSN":"1726-4170","issue":"22","language":"English","note":"publisher: Copernicus GmbH","page":"4551-4576","source":"Copernicus Online Journals","title":"Toward coherent space–time mapping of seagrass cover from satellite data: an example of a Mediterranean lagoon","title-short":"Toward coherent space–time mapping of seagrass cover from satellite data","URL":"https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/20/4551/2023/","volume":"20","author":[{"family":"Goodwin","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Marani","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Silvestri","given":"Sonia"},{"family":"Carniello","given":"Luca"},{"family":"D'Alpaos","given":"Andrea"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,5]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"citation-key":"goodwinCoherentSpaceTime2023","library":"My Library","citekey":"goodwinCoherentSpaceTime2023"},{"id":"madhuanandEnhancingPredictivePerformance2023","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Tidal flats are among the ecologically richest areas of the world where sediment composition (e.g. median grain size and silt content) and the macrozoobenthic presence play an important role in the health of the ecosystem. Regular monitoring of environmental and ecological variables is essential for sustainable management of the area. While monitoring based on field sampling is very time-consuming, the predictive performance of these variables using satellite images is low due to the spectral homogeneity over these regions. We tested a novel approach that uses features from a variational autoencoder (VAE) model to enhance the predictive performance of remote sensing images for environmental and ecological variables of tidal flats. The model was trained using the Sentinel-2 spectral bands to reproduce the input images, and during this process, the VAE model represents important information on the tidal flats within its layer structure. The information in the layers of the trained model was extracted to form features with identical spatial coverage to the spectral bands. The features and the spectral bands together form the input to random forest models to predict field observations of the sediment characteristics such as median grain size and silt content, as well as the macrozoobenthic biomass and species richness. The maximum prediction accuracy of feature-based maps was close to 62% for the sediment characteristics and 37% for benthic fauna indices. The encoded features improved the prediction accuracy of the random forest regressor model by 15% points on average in comparison to using just the spectral bands.

However, these methods trained in a Closed Set of classes fail when new classes are found in the test phase, not being able to recognize that an unseen class has been fed. This means that they are not suitable for Open Set scenarios, which are very common in real-world computer vision and remote sensing applications. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of Closed Set segmentation and propose two fully convolutional approaches to effectively address Open Set semantic segmentation: OpenFCN and OpenPCS. OpenFCN is based on the well-known OpenMax algorithm, configuring a new application of this approach in segmentation settings. OpenPCS is a fully novel approach based on feature-space from DNN activations that serve as features for computing PCA and multi-variate gaussian likelihood in a lower dimensional space. In addition to OpenPCS and aiming to reduce the RAM memory requirements of the methodology, we also propose a slight variation of the method (OpenIPCS) that uses an iteractive version of PCA able to be trained in small batches. Experiments were conducted on the well-known ISPRS Vaihingen/Potsdam and the 2018 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Challenge datasets. OpenFCN showed little-to-no improvement when compared to the simpler and much more time efficient SoftMax thresholding, while being some orders of magnitude slower. OpenPCS achieved promising results in almost all experiments by overcoming both OpenFCN and SoftMax thresholding. OpenPCS is also a reasonable compromise between the runtime performances of the extremely fast SoftMax thresholding and the extremely slow OpenFCN, being able to run close to real-time. Experiments also indicate that OpenPCS is effective, robust and suitable for Open Set segmentation, being able to improve the recognition of unknown class pixels without reducing the accuracy on the known class pixels. We also tested the scenario of hiding multiple known classes to simulate multimodal unknowns, resulting in an even larger gap between OpenPCS/OpenIPCS and both SoftMax thresholding and OpenFCN, implying that gaussian modeling is more robust to settings with greater openness.","container-title":"Machine Learning","DOI":"10.1007/s10994-021-06027-1","ISSN":"1573-0565","issue":"5","journalAbbreviation":"Mach Learn","language":"en","page":"1733-1784","source":"Springer Link","title":"Fully convolutional open set segmentation","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-06027-1","volume":"112","author":[{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Caio"},{"family":"Machado","given":"Gabriel L.

We query the published literature to answer these questions and synthesize the results quantitatively to provide a comprehensive review of the field over the past three decades. Categories of benthic habitat maps are differentiated unambiguously by the response variable (i.e., the subject being mapped) rather than the approaches used to produce the map. Additional terminology in the literature is clarified and defined based on provenance, statistical criteria, and common usage. Mapping approaches, models, data sets, technologies, and a range of other attributes are reviewed based on their application, and we document changes to the ways that these components have been integrated to map benthic habitats over time. We found that the use of acoustic remote sensing has been surpassed by optical methods for obtaining benthic environmental data. Although a wide variety of approaches are employed to ground truth habitat maps, underwater imagery has become the most common validation tool – surpassing physical sampling. The use of empirical machine learning models to process these data has increased dramatically over the past 10 years, and has superseded expert manual interpretation. We discuss how map products derived from these data and approaches are used to address ecological questions in the emerging field of seascape ecology, and how remote sensing technologies and field survey logistics pose different challenges to this research field across benthic ecosystems from intertidal and shallow sublittoral regions to the deep ocean. Outstanding challenges are identified and discussed in context with the trajectory of the field.","container-title":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecss.2023.108599","ISSN":"0272-7714","journalAbbreviation":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","page":"108599","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Benthic habitat mapping: A review of three decades of mapping biological patterns on the seafloor","title-short":"Benthic habitat mapping","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277142300389X","volume":"296","author":[{"family":"Misiuk","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Craig J."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,26]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"citation-key":"misiukBenthicHabitatMapping2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"misiukBenthicHabitatMapping2024"},{"id":"lyonsLongTermLand2012","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Long term global archives of high-moderate spatial resolution, multi-spectral satellite imagery are now readily accessible, but are not being fully utilised by management agencies due to the lack of appropriate methods to consistently produce accurate and timely management ready information. This work developed an object-based remote sensing approach to map land cover and seagrass distribution in an Australian coastal environment for a 38year Landsat image time-series archive (1972–2010). Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery were used without in situ field data input (but still using field knowledge) to produce land and seagrass cover maps every year data were available, resulting in over 60 map products over the 38year archive. Land cover was mapped annually using vegetation, bare ground, urban and agricultural classes. Seagrass distribution was also mapped annually, and in some years monthly, via horizontal projected foliage cover classes, sand and deep water. Land cover products were validated using aerial photography and seagrass maps were validated with field survey data, producing several measures of accuracy. An average overall accuracy of 65% and 80% was reported for seagrass and land cover products respectively, which is consistent with other studies in the area. This study is the first to show moderate spatial resolution, long term annual changes in land cover and seagrass in an Australian environment, created without the use of in situ data; and only one of a few similar studies globally. The land cover products identify several long term trends; such as significant increases in South East Queensland’s urban density and extent, vegetation clearing in rural and rural-residential areas, and inter-annual variation in dry vegetation types in western South East Queensland. The seagrass cover products show that there has been a minimal overall change in seagrass extent, but that seagrass cover level distribution is extremely dynamic; evidenced by large scale migrations of higher seagrass cover levels and several sudden and significant changes in cover level. These mapping products will allow management agencies to build a baseline assessment of their resources, understand past changes and help inform implementation and planning of management policy to address potential future changes.","container-title":"ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2012.05.002","ISSN":"0924-2716","journalAbbreviation":"ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","page":"34-46","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Long term land cover and seagrass mapping using Landsat and object-based image analysis from 1972 to 2010 in the coastal environment of South East Queensland, Australia","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271612000810","volume":"71","author":[{"family":"Lyons","given":"Mitchell B."},{"family":"Phinn","given":"Stuart R."},{"family":"Roelfsema","given":"Chris M."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,27]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",7,1]]},"citation-key":"lyonsLongTermLand2012","library":"My Library","citekey":"lyonsLongTermLand2012"}]
